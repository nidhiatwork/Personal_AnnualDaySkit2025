Jiyana (Stops and points):
"Hey! What's that? It wasn't here before!"

Myra (Bends down and pretends to wipe dust)
"It's shiny... and funny-looking! Is it... a robot?"

Jiyana: (Gasps, holds cheeks)
"Nooo! I think... it's a TIME MACHINE!"

Myra (Looking confused)
"Time machine? What does that do?"

Jiyana: (Spreads arms wide)
"It takes us to the PAST... or the FUTURE! Like magic travel!"

Myra: (Finds a big book, blows dust off with a puff)
"Magic Travel .... Wow "and Look! There's a A book! And it says... Guru Kul?!"

Jiyana:
"Guru Kul? What's that? Is it a game?"

Myra (Giggles, holding the book carefully)
"Nope! It's a guide from long ago... children learned under the guidance of a wise teacher—a Guru!"

Jiyana
"Wow! They learned with nature! That's so cool!"

Myra (With wonder)
"Yeah! No screens... just birds, books, and big ideas!"

Jiyana (Pressing buttons on the machine)
"Let's go see that old school! Are you ready?"

Myra
"Yes! Let's GO!"

Jiyana and Myra Both Together: (Hands in air, big smiles)
"1... 2... 3... ZOOOM!"

(Sound: Whirring machine, magical sparkle. Smoke fills stage. Lights change from bright to golden yellow. Tabla & flute play softly in background. New backdrop appears: forest, river, huts. Children in traditional dress enter, holding bows, clay pots, scrolls.)

Jiyana (Covering eyes, amazed)
"Wow! Look around! Trees... huts... no buildings!"

Jiyana (Pointing excitedly)
"Look! Children are sitting on the floor... and there's the GURU!"
(A Guru hums in slowly and sits under a tree. Children stand in a circle around him.)

Myra (pointing)
"See! They're folding hands... what are they saying?"

Jiyana: (curious)
"It's a prayer... like magic words for the teacher!"

All Gurukul Children:
"Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo Maheshwara, Guru Sakshat Para Brahma, Tasmai Shri Gurave Namah!"
Pranam guruji


Jiyana:
"Look... the children are folding their hands, smiling at their Guru, and learning with so much respect! Wow... I wonder what their school looks like... the mats, the trees, the little river... let's go and see all the fun things they do here!"

Jiyana: (whispering to Myra, excited)
"Myra, look! That is Guruji!"

Myra
"Yes! He is teaching under the tree. How peaceful it looks!"

Jiyana:
"Let's go and meet him!"

Both Together:
"Namaste, Guruji!"

Guruji: (smiling kindly)
"Namaste, my dear children. Who are you? I haven't seen you in my school before."

Jiyana:
"Guruji, we come from another time — from the future!"

Myra: (excitedly)
"Yes, Guruji! We came in a magic time machine! We wanted to see how children learn here."

Guruji: (smiling, curious)
"Oh! That's wonderful! What do you see in my school, children?"

Jiyana
"We saw how children are learning with love. They sit under trees and listen so nicely"

Myra
"Yes, and they respect you so much, Guruji! It feels so calm here."

Guruji: (nodding with pride)
"Yes, children. Here we learn with heart, with hands, and with honesty."

Joyana: (smiling)
"Guruji, can you come with us to our school? We want to show you our classroom."

Myra
"Yes! And we want you to meet our parents too. They will be very happy!"

Guruji: (smiling warmly, lifting hand in blessing)
"I would love to come, my children. Let's go together and see your world."
(Soft music plays — time machine sound. Light dims slowly as they prepare to travel.)

Guruji: (smiling, happy)
"Wow! Your school is full of joy! Children are learning happily, just like in my school, but with fun games too!

Harshvardhan:
What a fabulous show! Please look louder for our amazing performers!"
They practiced with so much dedication and love.
Let's cheer once more for their spirit and smiles!"

Jiyana:
"Guruji the stage is ready now let see another performance"

Myra (excited, pointing to dancing children)
"Guruji! Look! In our school, we say happy words every day!"

Jiyana:
"Yes! We say 'I can do it!' and 'I am smart!' It makes us feel strong and brave!"


Guruji: (smiling, putting hands together)
"Very good! Saying happy words is very important. It helps children believe in themselves and feel confident."

Jiyana
"See, Guruji! We say them every morning. It makes our day bright!"

Myra
"Yes! It helps us be kind, smile, and do our best!

Guruji (Smiling and blessing them):
"Children, your school is full of joy and positivity. Keep learning with happiness and kind words, always!"


Jiyana:
now it's a SPTM day in school.

(Setup: Classroom with one table and few chairs. Teacher is sitting. Two parents come one by one. Guruji stands quietly on one side, watching everything with a smile.)

Jiyana:
"Guruji Now let's go to our music class."

Myra:
"Guruji here parents come to meet teacher sand they share progress and feedback with each other."
